Bario game..:-)

Building a Mario inspired game.

The current game allows for our hero Bario to move along the map, spawn items, kill badies and wrap to other maps.

Coin tracker as well.

Press <- Left to move left.

Press -> Right to move right.

Pressing the space bar allows Bario to jump and by jumping and "headbutting" a block Bario can produce different effects depending on the block that is hit. 

Bario can kills by the enemies by jumping on them.

Bario can also wrap to another area by pressing the DOWN key on top of a tube.

Will update as game levels up.
